# Awesome angr [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A collection of resources/tools and analyses for the [angr](https://github.com/angr) binary analysis framework.
This page does not only collect links and external resources, but its meant to be an harbour to release any non-official extensions/tool/utils that can be useful when working with angr.

## ExplorationTechniques üìÅ

A collection of exploration techniques written by the community

* *SimgrViz*: an exploration technique that collects information regarding the states generated by the SimulationManager and creates a graph that can be later visualized to debug the analyses (.dot file). 
* *MemLimiter*: an exploration technique to stop the analysis when memory consumption is too high!
* *ExplosionDetector*: stop the analysis when there are too many states or other critical errors happen.
